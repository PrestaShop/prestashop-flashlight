# Example: with init scripts

This is an example of a running PrestaShop Flashlight with custom init scripts.
See [./init-scripts](./init-scripts).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** your init-scripts **MUST** be executable, and have a [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) to be run by flashlight at startup. Otherwise, they would be ignored.

## Test the example

The expected output of this example is:

```sh
docker compose up prestashop --force-recreate

[+] Running 3/2
